## Tutorial

Basic Pre-requisite:
- Data Extraction and Representation
- Data Analysis and Visualization
- Natural Language Processing


1. Find **five recipes** that you like the most from any of the online repositories.
    (a) Extract and represent the information from them in the traditional form (ingredients and
       cooking instructions); Example in the pdf attached.
    (b) Further, store the recipes in the form of a (Recipe ID)—(Ingredient Name) form.
    (c) In general, as well as specific to each recipe, comment on which aspects of the recipes are
       being lost in the process of coarse-graining the recipe data? 
    (d) How could one possibly mitigate this to extract the most details from the recipes? 

2. Obtain the data of recipes [from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset) and analyze it for the following.
    (a) Find number of recipes, number of unique ingredients, number of cuisines. 
    (b) Plot the statistics (bar plot) of number of recipes for each cuisine. 
    (c) Plot the recipe size distribution for each cuisine as well as for all the recipes.
    (d) Plot cumulative distribution of recipe size and **interpret**.
3. For the data of recipes [from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset):
    (a) Plot the frequency-rank distribution for all the recipes and interpret. 
    (b) List the 10 most popular ingredients in the recipes. 
    (c) Plot the ingredient-rank distribution for each of the cuisines and list the most popular
       ingredients for each cuisine. 
    (d) What is **your interpretation** of the results?
